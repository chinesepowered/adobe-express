## üåü Overview

The **Accessibility-First Design Validator** is a revolutionary Adobe Express Add-on that brings real-time accessibility validation directly into the design workflow. Instead of forcing users to export their designs and use external tools for accessibility checking, this add-on provides instant feedback and automated fixes right within the Adobe Express canvas.

- **Batch processing** to fix all issues simultaneously
- **Non-destructive editing** that preserves original design elements
- **Undo functionality** for all automated changes

## üéØ Target Problem & Solution

### The Problem
Current accessibility validation workflow is broken:
1. **Design in Express** ‚Üí Create beautiful layouts
2. **Export design** ‚Üí Leave the creative environment  
3. **Use external tools** ‚Üí Upload to separate accessibility checkers
4. **Find issues** ‚Üí Discover problems after design is "complete"
5. **Return to Express** ‚Üí Make fixes in isolation
6. **Repeat cycle** ‚Üí Test again externally

### Our Solution
**Integrated validation during design:**
1. **Design + Validate simultaneously** ‚Üí Real-time feedback as you create
2. **Visual overlay indicators** ‚Üí See issues directly on canvas
3. **Instant fix suggestions** ‚Üí

# Adobe Express Accessibility Validator Add-on

This project is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of an Accessibility-First Design Validator for Adobe Express, created for the Adobe Express Add-ons Hackathon.

## Core Idea

The add-on provides real-time accessibility validation directly within the Adobe Express canvas. It checks for common accessibility issues like color contrast, font size, and alt text, helping users create more inclusive designs without leaving their workflow.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

-   `src/`: Contains the source code for the add-on.
    -   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the add-on's UI panel.
    -   `index.js`: The core JavaScript logic for the add-on, including SDK integration and accessibility checks.
    -   `style.css`: The stylesheet for the add-on's UI.
    -   `demo.js`: Contains mock data and functions for demonstrating the add-on's features, as required for the hackathon video.
-   `dist/`: This directory will contain the bundled and optimized files for production. It's generated by webpack.
-   `manifest.json`: The manifest file that describes the add-on to Adobe Express.
-   `package.json`: Defines the project's dependencies and scripts.
-   `webpack.config.js`: The configuration file for webpack, which bundles the project's assets.
-   `README.md`: This file, providing information about the project.

## Getting Started

To run the add-on locally for development and testing, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Then, open a terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the webpack development server. This server will bundle the project's files and serve them locally. It will also automatically reload the add-on when you make changes to the source code.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start a local server, typically on `http://localhost:9000`. You will see output in your terminal indicating that the server is running.

### 3. Load the Add-on in Adobe Express

Now you can load your local add-on into Adobe Express to see it in action:

1.  Open [Adobe Express](https://express.adobe.com/).
2.  Create a new project or open an existing one.
3.  In the left-hand panel, click on **Add-ons**.
4.  At the bottom of the add-ons panel, click on **Manage add-ons**.
5.  In the **Developer Tools** section, click on **Load from computer**.
6.  In the dialog that appears, enter the URL of your local development server (e.g., `http://localhost:9000`) and click **Load**.

Your add-on's UI will now appear in the add-on panel in Adobe Express. You can interact with it and see it update in real-time as you modify the source code.

## How It Works

-   **Add-on SDK Integration**: The add-on uses the Adobe Express Add-on SDK to communicate with the Express editor. It can access the document's content, such as text and images, to perform its validation checks.
-   **Real-time Validation**: When you start the validation, the add-on fetches the elements from the current page and runs a series of checks on them.
-   **Color Contrast**: It calculates the contrast ratio between text color and its background (currently mocked as white, but can be improved to detect the actual background).
-   **Typography**: It checks for minimum font sizes to ensure readability.
-   **UI Panel**: All the results and controls are displayed in the add-on's panel, providing a seamless experience within Adobe Express.

This MVP sets the foundation for a powerful accessibility tool. For your hackathon submission, you can now record a video demonstrating these core features running in the local Express environment. Good luck!
