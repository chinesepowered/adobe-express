## 🎯 Target Problem & Solution

### The Problem
Current accessibility validation workflow is broken:
1. **Design in Express** → Create beautiful layouts
2. **Export design** → Leave the creative environment  
3. **Use external tools** → Upload to separate accessibility checkers
4. **Find issues** → Discover problems after design is "complete"
5. **Return to Express** → Make fixes in isolation
6. **Repeat cycle** → Test again externally

### Our Solution
**Integrated validation during design:**
1. **Design + Validate simultaneously** → Real-time feedback as you create
2. **Visual overlay indicators** → See issues directly on canvas
3. **Instant fix suggestions** →
